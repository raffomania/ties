# Contributing to ties

## Ways to Contribute

- Test & report bugs
- Improve the manual
- Propose new features
- Run your own instance
- Create UI concepts for new features
- Discuss how features should work with others
- Write code

## Guidelines

- **Do not check in code generated by LLMs.** Use them for other tasks if you want to, but we currently don't have the time to review LLM-generated code.
- **Ask questions.** Comment on issues, start discussions on GitHub, write an email to maintainers - there are no stupid questions.
